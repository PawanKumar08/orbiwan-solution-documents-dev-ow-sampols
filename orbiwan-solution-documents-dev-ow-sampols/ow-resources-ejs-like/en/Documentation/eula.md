### 9. Confidentiality

For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means any information that is confidential such as technical, commercial, strategic, financial, economic in nature, related to research, technical specifications, software, components, products, infrastructure, customers, network or business of a Party, on any medium, verbal, visual or written, and communicated to the other Party during the negotiations or the performance of this Agreement and Orders. The following information is not deemed Confidential Information:
i) Information that was already known to the Receiving Party before it was first communicated by the Disclosing Party, without confidentiality obligation;
ii) Information that was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or which came into the public domain subsequent to such disclosure without this being the result of an infringement of any confidentiality obligation incumbent on the Receiving Party or on a third party; or;
iii) Information that one Party received in good faith from a third party who itself has no confidentiality obligation towards the Disclosing Party in relation to such information.
Any Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable law or court order or requested by another authority legally authorized to demand such disclosure may be disclosed as required but only limited to the extent as necessary to follow such request. In case of such request, to the extent permissible by law, the Receiving Party shall provide prior notice to the Disclosing Party and provide the latter with a copy of the demand for which the disclosure is required.
Any Party receiving Confidential Information (the “Receiving Party”) from the other Party (the “Disclosing PARTY”) undertakes:
(i) To hold said information in strict confidence, and to not publish or disclose it to third parties;
(ii) To not use the information for any purpose other than that provided in the Agreement and Orders;
(iii) To take all measures necessary to protect confidentiality;
(iv) To limit circulation and access to its directors, employees, representatives, consultants or sub-contractors or those of its Affiliated Companies that need to know such information and, in this case, to inform these people of the confidential nature of the information;
(v) To not make any copies for third parties.
Any disclosure of confidential information to third parties can only happen with the other PARTY’s previous written consent, subject to this Article.
Any breach of this Article by the Receiving Party shall authorize the Disclosing Party to terminate as of right this Agreement and the Order, in accordance with Article “Termination”, without prejudice to any damages that the Disclosing Party could claim.
In case of an unauthorized use or communication of the Confidential Information, in most cases, compensation is not an adequate remedy: the nature of the Confidential Information means that action to safeguard confidentiality is required before loss or damage has occurred (which shall not prevent it to obtain compensation). Therefore, the Receiving PARTY acknowledges that the Disclosing Party is entitled to apply for emergency remedial action from any judge such as an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, against any person or entity that has breached or is threatening to breach this Article. In doing so, the Disclosing PARTY will not have to prove that it has already incurred or will incur actual loss or damage.
Upon termination of this Agreement or sooner upon Disclosing Party’s written request the Receiving Party shall immediately undertake to return, to destroy or to extinguish any written or otherwise recorded information received from the other Party, including any copies made, to the other Party. The Party requesting that all written information be returned, destroyed or extinguished must be issued with confirmation that all such information has been returned, destroyed or extinguished. The Parties acknowledge, however, that Confidential Information provided in electronic format (e.g. e-mail) may be copied by the Receiving Party as part of its back-up procedures and if such copies cannot be destroyed or returned to the Disclosing Party each Party agrees that it shall not access or utilize such copies following receipt of a request to return, destroy or extinguish Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party.
