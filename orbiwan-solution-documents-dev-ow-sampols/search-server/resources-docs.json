Then click OK. The device will be registered as seen below:As soon as you’re done with registering your devices and gateways, you will be able to see each device send a join request to the network. Once the device joins the network, it can start sending the uplink messages.You can see each device’s payloads in Devices –> Select your device –> Action –> View Data.Clicking on the View Data button will open the Device Activity page where you can see all of the uplink and downlink messages of the selected device.",

To add an application follow the simple steps below: Navigate to the Applications menu –> Add Application  This will open Manage App which allows you to add an application.

As seen in the screenshot: The Hostname is the DNS or IP of the external HTTP/HTTPS application.The Port must be entered if external application is using specific port.The Path prefix is the external application URL where the packets to be pushed, i.e /app2/ul/data from application URL (https://app.orbiwise.com/app2/ul/data)  In case the external application supports Authentication, OrbiWAN can be configured to use it to make connections.  Once you’re done adding the application, You need to start the application via Action –> Start Push which will start pushing all the payloads to the application.Although you have added the application it will only receive the data once the application is assigned to the device(s).
